# 📘 DBMS Roadmap: Beginner to Advanced

This roadmap will guide you through the entire Database Management System (DBMS) journey — from basic concepts to advanced topics, including real-world projects and practice.

## 🔰 Phase 1: Introduction to DBMS

**Goal:** Understand what DBMS is and why it's important.

-  What is DBMS?
-  File System vs DBMS
-  Types of DBMS (Hierarchical, Network, Relational, Object-Oriented)
-  DBMS vs RDBMS

## 📦 Phase 2: DBMS Architecture & Data Models

**Goal:** Learn how data is organized and accessed internally.

-  Data Models: Relational, Hierarchical, Network
-  DBMS Architecture: 1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier
-  Schema & Instance: Internal, Conceptual, External


## 📦 Phase 3: ER Model & Relational Model

**Goal:** Design databases using Entity-Relationship modeling.

-  Entities & Attributes (Simple, Composite, Derived)
-  Relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N)
-  ER Diagrams
-  Mapping ER to Relational Tables
-  Keys: Primary, Foreign, Candidate, Super


## 📦 Phase 4: Relational Algebra & Relational Calculus

**Goal:** Understand the mathematical foundation of database queries.

-  Relational Algebra: SELECT, PROJECT, UNION, JOIN, DIVIDE, etc.
-  Relational Calculus: Tuple (TRC) and Domain (DRC)

📌 Useful for competitive exams and theoretical understanding.


## 📦 Phase 5: SQL (Structured Query Language)

**Goal:** Learn to interact with databases using SQL.

-  DDL: `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`
-  DML: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
-  DQL: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
-  DCL: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`
-  TCL: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`

## 📦 Phase 6: Normalization & Functional Dependencies

**Goal:** Minimize data redundancy and ensure data consistency.

-  Functional Dependencies
-  1NF, 2NF, 3NF
-  BCNF, 4NF
-  Decomposition (Lossless, Dependency Preserving)

💡 Practice normalization with sample tables.


## 📦 Phase 7: Transactions & Concurrency Control

**Goal:** Ensure safe and consistent data access in multi-user environments.

-  Transactions & ACID Properties
-  Concurrency Control: Locks, Timestamping
-  Serializability: Conflict, View
-  Deadlock Handling: Wait-Die, Wound-Wait


## 📦 Phase 8: Storage, File Organization & Indexing

**Goal:** Learn how DBMS handles data storage and access speed.

-  File Organization: Heap, Sorted, Hashed
-  Indexing: Single-Level, Multi-Level, B+ Trees
-  Buffer Management

---

## 📦 Phase 9: Security & Authorization

**Goal:** Protect and control access to sensitive data.

-  Access Control and Roles
-  Data Encryption
-  Backup & Recovery (Full, Incremental, Differential)

## 📦 Phase 10: Projects and Practice

**Goal:** Apply your knowledge to real-world use cases.
